### Analyzing bias in supervised learning algorithms: Challenges in comment toxicity classification on minority groups

Do we need to re-imagine classification algorithms while dealing with minority groups in a society - this question is what drives the discussion of this paper. The research paper examines how fair a classification model that predicts the toxicity of Twitter comments is for minority groups. The work also includes a critical analysis of the effects that data gaps in minority communities bring to the model.

This work was developed as part of an assessment for the course: Introduction to Machine learning (COMP90049) at the Univeristy of Melbourne.
